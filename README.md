Thoughts about using nodejs at a deper level of the linux OS.

I intend this to intially be a collection of written down ideas, and eventually evolve into an actual software repository.

My main concern here is how to make nodejs more integrated to software deployed on linux. Maybe we can actually build nodejs as a kernel module, and hence have native threads actually be nodejs threads. It's food for thought.
